# WillCommons - A Lightweight Framework for Cities: Skylines Mod Development  
Designed for creating small-scale mods, this framework is inspired by [AlgernonCommons](https://github.com/algernon-A/AlgernonCommons), an excellent and comprehensive framework developed by @algernon-A. I deeply appreciate his work and extend my heartfelt thanks!  

WillCommons aims to provide a simple and efficient environment to help developers create their own mods with ease.
